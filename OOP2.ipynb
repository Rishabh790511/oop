    "Abstraction in object-oriented programming (OOP) is the concept of simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors they share. It involves hiding the complex implementation details of an object and exposing only the necessary features. Abstraction allows you to focus on what an object does without needing to understand how it achieves its functionality internally."
