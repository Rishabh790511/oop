    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data, restricting access to some of the object's components. It helps in hiding the internal implementation details of an object and allows access only through well-defined interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors they share. It allows focusing on the essential features of an object while ignoring the non-essential details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (superclass or base class). It promotes code reuse and the creation of a hierarchy of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It enables a single interface to represent different types of objects and allows methods to be applied to objects of various types"
